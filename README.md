# SW-3240 - A modular ESP-32 e-stim device

## About
The SW-3240 is a modular e-stim unit, with the ESP-32 microcontroller at the core. It supports a max of four output (stim) channels, and two AUX channels.
Modular output boards try to mimic the output stage of the well-known Erostec ET312 or better, the DIY reverse engineered MK-312.

The main board makes use of an RP2040 microcontroller (Raspberry Pi Pico) for low-level control of the output boards. An ESP-32 takes care of the higher-level processing such as pattern/routine generation, Bluetooth, and user input/output.

Most connections are connected directly into the microcontroller as separate signals. Allowing the firmware to customize how the board functions.
For example, the AUX channels with the help of a plug-in module could accept line/microphone input, or an output channel could be rewired to handle TTL RS-232, etc.

Additionally, the SW-3240 was designed with the front panel/display being an optional accessory. Anything that can be achieved on the front panel, can be done via Bluetooth.

## Structure
The project is split into multiple KiCad sub-projects:
- [Main Board](/hardware/pcb/main_board) [[Schematic](/hardware/pcb/main_board/SW-3240.pdf)] - This is the core of the project, the main control board that can support up to four output channels.
- [Front Panel](/hardware/pcb/front_panel) [[Schematic](/hardware/pcb/front_panel/SW-3240FP.pdf)] - The front panel with the ESP-32 processor.

### Modules
- [SW-32MO10](/hardware/pcb/modules/output/SW-32MO10) [[Schematic](/hardware/pcb/modules/output/SW-32MO10/SW-32MO10.pdf)] - A single isolated output module.
- [SW-32MA1](/hardware/pcb/modules/audio/SW-32MA1) [[Schematic](/hardware/pcb/modules/audio/SW-32MA1/SW-32MA1.pdf)] - A basic audio module, supports a mono microphone and stereo line-in.

More detailed information about each can be found in the project specific READMEs.
