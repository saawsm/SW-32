# SW-3240 - Main Board
<img align="center" src="../../../doc/images/SW-3240.png">

## About
This is a main board of SW-3240. It supports a max of four output (stim) channels, and two AUX channels.
It provides power (+3.3V, +5V, and +9V), battery charging, low-level control of the output modules (via RP2040/Raspberry Pi Pico), and high-level control via an ESP-32.

Each of the four output channels can be potentially repurposed for other uses (since each channel is a module board). Each channel has the following connections controlled by the RP2040/Pico:
- 2x GPIO
- 1x 12-bit ADC
- 1x 12-bit DAC
- +9V 3A max (between all channels)
- +3.3V 1A max (main board total)
